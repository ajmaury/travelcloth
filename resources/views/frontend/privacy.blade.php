                click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you away from one of our websites onto a different
                web site. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit

                note when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third-party websites or
                applications before submitting any Protected Information to third parties.</p>
